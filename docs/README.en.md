## Introduction

> DingTalk official provides three protection measures to ensure the security of your custom robot during usage.
> These measures include setting custom keywords, signing (using signature encryption), and IP address (range) restrictions. These methods effectively protect your robot from malicious attacks.

For more details, refer to [DingTalk Documentation](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/orgapp/customize-robot-security-settings).

This project uses the signature method to send messages.
The signing method is a bi-directional security authentication between DingTalk robot and the developer to verify its security.
